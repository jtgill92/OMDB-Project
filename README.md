# OMDB-Project
Simple project using the OMDb API

To Relias Learning:
This is my first experience with any kind of web development. For this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. All three were new to me. I am used to using primarily Java, C#, and C++, so this was a fun departure from the norm for me. I learned a lot working on this the past few days. Lastly, I wish had more time to write better documentation. It isn't like me write such terse explanations of my code. Thanks again for considering me for this position. I look forward to the next steps in this process.
